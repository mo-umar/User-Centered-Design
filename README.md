# User Centered Design Project
## Deliverable #1 - Data Gathering and User Analysis
Your first task is to meet with your partner and present the functionalities you requested and have had approved. You may not duplicate efforts; a functionality can be built by ONLY ONE PERSON.

For this deliverable, you plan which data gathering techniques you will need to apply for understanding the users for your project and perform them to collect the needed requirements. As mentioned earlier, your user is your partner.

You will likely see your requirements change slightly during this process. After all, it is USER-CENTERED DESIGN!

**What you need to do:**

**Part 1. Plan your user research**
Plan an interview with your user. This must be a semi-structured interview. You should prepare a list of no less than 15 questions. Your questions should lead to conversation about the user's expectations and other questions may arise. I would recommend a synchronous meeting online, but you can also handle this asynchronously. 

Choose a second complementary method from the ones covered in this module that is NOT AN INTERVIEW that is appropriate to help you understand the topic and/or potential users (surveys, interviews, focus groups, observations, IDEO cards, diary studies, etc.,). Make sure you can justify your reason for choosing this second method, and understand how it compliments your interview.  Note: if you choose a group-based research method, you will have to find your own group of people!  You are welcome to use the D2L discussion forum to ask for help from your peers. 

**Part 2. Conduct your user research**
Conduct the planned data gathering. YOU WILL HAVE TO MEET/COMMUNICATE WITH YOUR PARTNER TO CONDUCT YOUR FIRST METHOD!  Please note: you are not required to enlist or work with other, outside users, but that might work well for you. For instance, some students find that creating an informal focus group with friends or family is helpful.  If you do find outside users, your write up for should include a description of the users you worked with and a summary of the findings.  Please do not include personal information of your users here other than name, along with the results of your research. 

**Part 3. Generate requirements and personas**
Once you have collected data from your methods, describe the major requests from users. What are the breakdowns you observed? The contexts of use for which it should be able to work? This should be presented as a bullet list of things your solution should do.

Using the data from your user research and the guidelines presented in class, create one fictional persona. This persona should be realistic, but based on an aggregation of the data you've collected on potential users and their goals. Each persona should be presented on a single page, include a picture, a name, a representative quote, a short biography, goals for the system, demographic data, and technical background. NOTE: Your persona might be a typical users that is not necessarily your partner.

## Deliverable #2 - Functional Requirements and HTA
Using the functional requirements that you provided previously and any additional plans for the application, create a Hierachical Task Analysis that supports EVERY screen you plan to include in your functionality.  NOTE: Sketches of the screens are not required for this assignment. 

Please start with a BRIEF (2-3 sentence) paragraph (not bullets) that highlights your functionality. If it was done correctly, you should be able to re-use some or all of what you provided in deliverable #1.   

Your HTA should follow and be numbered in an outlined fashion like the example. Please label the features 1, 2, 3, and 4, with your subtasks appropriately numbered and indented.  You may find that it helps to start with a flow chart (if you are a visual learner), but do not submit a flowchart in place of the outline. Once again, your offerings should have sufficient depth to have some substance here.  If your HTA is less than a two pages single spaced, you need to ask your user to work with you to beef up the requirements.  

At the very minimum, you should represent of all of the screens that support the depth and breadth of your features.
